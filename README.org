My PhD manuscript.  Latest HTML version is available at [[https://fmdkdd.github.io/phd-manuscript/][fmdkdd/phd-manuscript]].

I build the HTML version with:
- Emacs 25.1.1 (but 24.5.1 works as well); with Org mode 8.3.5
- bibtex2html 1.98
- xmlstarlet 1.6.1, GNU parallel 20160822, rsvg-convert 2.40.16 (for SVG export)

I fixed an annoying bounding box behavior in rsvg-convert, the patch is in the
~bin~ folder.

The SVGs use [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/][Fira Sans Condensed]] and [[http://font.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu Mono]] (can be packaged by your
distribution).  The body font is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter][Charter]], with Fira Sans for the titles and
Fira Mono for the code snippets.

The PDF version is built with:
- Emacs 25.1.1 (but 24.5.1 works as well); with Org mode 8.3.5
- XeLaTeX 3.14159265-0.99996 (TeX Live 2016/Arch Linux)
- Latexmk 4.45

You can find pre-built PDF in the [[https://github.com/fmdkdd/phd-manuscript/releases][releases]].

(Note to self: there are git hooks under ~bin~ worth using.)
